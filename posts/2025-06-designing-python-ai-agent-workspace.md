### TL;DR – I spent a day sketching the rails before letting an AI-powered train leave the station. The result is a layered design—bootstrap, tests, security, docs, release, and agent scaffolds—meant to keep the project quick on its feet after the honeymoon phase.

## A quieter day after a noisy week

My first attempt followed the "move fast, fix later" playbook. Codex and Cursor issued roughly fifty pull requests in a blur of green check-marks—until everything slowed. The agents stopped recognising their own conventions; the domain language still lived only in my head. Progress soon felt like herding cats: each agent wandered off its own convention, and keeping them all in line took more effort than writing new features.

So I tried the opposite experiment. I blocked off a single, focused day to design—no feature code, just structure. By the end of that day I had drafted more than forty Architecture Decision Records and a dependency-ordered backlog ready for parallel implementation. The design won't solve every future problem, but it should stop early velocity from sinking into a swamp.

I share this because many teams have reported the same arc: early AI excitement, followed by a slowdown once complexity appears. That pattern feels less like a problem and more like an open opportunity worth cracking.

## Why plan first?

Speed remains the goal; but I think we are realizing it is something earned by clearing friction from the loops that run most often, rather than a free AI-gimmie. There's no use driving a fast car if you can't keep it from crashing into traffic.

The guiding question was always, *"Will this choice lower the long-term cost of secure, maintainable speed?"* A tool that saves fifteen seconds on every CI run but takes a day to debug once a year is worth it. One that saves a minute today but adds uncertainty six months out usually is not.

---

## Three guiding goals

1. **Bounded cycle-time.** An AI agent already waits about eight minutes for a Codex run; CI should not cost another eight.
2. **Shift-left robustness.** Tests, security, docs, and performance checks run from the first commit, so complexity grows linearly.
3. **Agent-friendly scaffolds.** Every repetitive task has a deterministic, one-command recipe, and every new capability advertises itself through a single declarative contract \[e.g., a Weather tool declares its input and output schema]. Agents discover what exists from high-level models instead of reverse engineering structure from file layouts and content at run time.

---

## The loops we tightened

* **Commit loops** fire quickly and locally, keeping feedback under a minute.
* **Release loops** package, tag, and document in one motion.
* **Security loops** surface issues early; guard-rails let agents run unattended while humans handle nuance.

If that feels like too much work on day one, consider the clock speed of agents. They push code around the clock, so a missing guard-rail can hurt days or weeks earlier than it would on a human-only team. A few hours of wiring now beats a long stretch of future damage control. What's costly and difficult to set up in a greenfield project is often unaffordable in a mature code-base (so at that point you're usually stuck with what you've got because of the negative tradeoff between risk/benefit).

### Design-up-front is not Waterfall 2.0

If your "Mythical Man Month", "This is just Waterfall repackaged" spidey sense is tingling, you're technically not wrong. However, classic waterfall assumed long spec cycles and expensive change. **Waterfall + Agents feels different:** agents iterate continuously, but they need clear, deterministic rules to stay within bounds. We lay the rails first, then let the train run. It is still "move fast," just not "move fast and hope." Or, borrowing SpaceX's phrasing: *move fast and break staging, not production.*

If that still doesn't convince you, tell me this: what's the difference between a sprint plan and a waterfall SDLC? Aren't they mostly the same other than scope and time bounds? I don't think it's far fetched to presume we'll soon have agents completing a sprint's worth of stories in a single day. In fact, I'd even argue we're already there (if we're talking junior level SEs), it just doesn't quite feel like it because the bottleneck is still the human reviewer who needs to see if the models haven't suddenly turned to cats that need herding.

I can't quite pin my finger on it, but it really does feel like design up front is the sensible approach to AI-agent-based software development, at least in the near term future. I'm sure they'll eventually adopt an agile mindset, but agile doesn't quite seem to work without some weather-worn lead gently steering the juniors to sensible sprints.

## The design backlog in outline

1. **Environment cornerstone** – `bootstrap.sh` plus a lockfile; pre-commit hooks installed automatically.
2. **Quality gates** – Ruff linting, Ty static types, Typeguard runtime checks, BDD and property tests, coverage thresholds.
3. **Security & compliance** – pip-audit, Bandit, CodeQL, Gitleaks, Trivy, licence allow-list.
4. **Release & dependency flow** – Conventional Commits, semantic-release, Renovate, coverage comments, performance guard.
5. **Documentation & DX** – Sphinx + MyST, API and CLI references, diagram rendering, dev-container.
6. **Runtime & orchestration** – signed container image, SBOMs, Tilt live-reload, Hatch workspaces.
7. **AI-agent layer** – LangGraph backbone, tool registry, schema exports, contract fuzzing, cookie-cutter agents.
8. **Workflow polish** – Justfile command palette, smart labels, issue templates, minimal CI skeleton.

## Trade-off heuristics

When picking tools, we choose speed over familiarity and write architecture decision records (ADRs) for low lock-in. We keep a single source of truth for each concept rather than distributing conventions implictly all over the code base (that's hard for agents to follow, at least for now). We aim for tunability: start permissive, tighten later as needed. 

This last part may seem counterintuitive: if we tighten constraints later, doesn't that mean we'll have a ton of refactoring to do? This is a little speculative at this point, but I'm looking at this as some sort of meta-level transaction log, where we have some fuzzy actions that we can replay on our repo as commands given to agents to implement. This is every newly-onboarded developers dream: nuke the repo and start from scratch. While this doesn't make sense from a cost/benefit perspective when it comes to human developers, my intuition says that the speed and costs of using AI-agents means there's a phase-shift of what problems can be "started from scratch", even at the level of an entire codebase. Remember, we have the commit history that we can replay as context for prompts... so its really X + Y + delta (where delta is something like "tighter security bounds"), and we already have X and Y, rather than X + Z where Z is something new the agent has to figure out from scratch.

My intuition says that if we start too strict, since LLMs are trained on already existing code, and most of that code is not yet strict, they won't give robust solutions. If we are trying to have the model follow some valley of embedding-space battle-tested solutions, that'll only happen if there were enough of those in its training set. A similar intuition guides the need for the agent to write clean, well-formatted code: since most "good" developers write clean, well-organized code, when we force the agent to do the same, it will have to give answers coming from that region of its embedded space. Maybe my intuition is off since I don't quite understand the way LLMs work, but this seems sensible to me. Please let me know if that makes sense.

## Advice if you try this

Use a template as an idea checklist, not a blueprint. Ask whether each tool will shorten feedback loops six months from now. Record *why* in ADRs. Expect to swap tools; design exits rather than betting on permanence.

## What comes next

* **Implementation diaries.** Watching models turn stories into code.
* **High-level, low-code modelling.** Declarative descriptions of sprints and sagas so agents reason above file level.
* **Project-manager agents.** Coordinators who steer other agents without touching code.

Designing the rails was work, but also satisfying. Seeing messy parts click into place made the effort feel worthwhile—and necessary.

### “Isn’t this a bit… much?”

You might be wondering why I bothered with forty-odd decision records when there is no product, no MVP, no POC—no **GPT**-“Great Prototype, Trust me.” Conventional wisdom says start with a linter, a formatter, maybe a test runner, and add the fancy parts later. That advice is sensible for a weekend side project or a proof of concept that will be thrown away on Monday.

The calculation changes when you want a production-grade system that will be touched by autonomous agents. Agents do not pace themselves the way people do. They can open ten pull requests before lunch, and if each one introduces a tiny inconsistency or an unpatched dependency, the compound interest on that tech debt arrives overnight. Guard-rails that feel like luxury options on a human-only project become basic seatbelts the moment you hand the steering wheel to a model.

The same argument even applies to smaller, “toy” projects once an agent is involved. A model may generate code that looks clean, but it cannot yet guarantee that a dependency is free of known CVEs or that a commit message follows any convention your release tooling can understand. Lacking those signals, your CI pipeline either blocks useful work or waves through latent bugs. Automating the checks from day one short-circuits that dilemma.

Sceptics will say this is all conjecture: maybe future foundation models will embed secure defaults, maybe they will write perfect commit messages. That may happen, but it is not true today, and every headline about a leaked key or supply-chain breach reminds me that “maybe” is not a release plan. The safer bet is to wire proven practices into the toolchain, then let the models run inside that frame.

Could the extra design still be wasted effort? Possibly. Yet the cost is a single day up front, and the upside is months of smoother velocity. I would rather discover I over-planned than find out fifty pull requests in that I need to pause development to retrofit security scans, release gates, and documentation generators (since its gotten too complex for an AI agent to do in one shot).

Push-back is welcome. Your team, domain, or language model might thrive with less structure; the right balance is always a local trade-off that depends on your stack, use-case, and crew. That is why every choice lives in an ADR: the reasoning is captured, so revisiting a decision is a pull request— not an archaeological dig. If a guard-rail later feels heavy, we can loosen or remove it without tearing up the track. Until then, I prefer to aim a little over-secure rather than discover, mid-sprint, that the safety net is too thin.

Security, style, and architecture cut across the entire codebase; fixing them after launch means large, risky refactors that rarely clear the cost-benefit bar. Our grandparents were right: a stitch in time really does save nine.

And if super-intelligent machines eventually descend to refactor the project from orbit, at least they’ll land on clear decisions, automated safeguards, and a clean release history—a small professional courtesy for our future silicon colleagues.
