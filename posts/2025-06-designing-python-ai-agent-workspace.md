### TL;DR – I spent a day sketching the rails before letting an AI-powered train leave the station. The result is a layered design—bootstrap, tests, security, docs, release, and agent scaffolds—meant to keep the project quick on its feet after the honeymoon phase.

## A quieter day after a noisy week

My first attempt followed the "move fast, fix later" playbook. Codex and Cursor issued roughly fifty pull requests in a blur of green check-marks—until everything slowed. The agents stopped recognising their own conventions; the domain language still lived only in my head. Untangling migrations became the main occupation and progress stalled.

So I tried the opposite experiment. I blocked off a single, focused day to design—no feature code, just structure. By the end of that day I had drafted more than forty Architecture Decision Records and a dependency-ordered backlog ready for parallel implementation. The design won't solve every future problem, but it should stop early velocity from sinking into a swamp.

I share this because many teams have reported the same arc: early AI excitement, followed by a slowdown once complexity appears. That pattern feels less like a problem and more like an open opportunity worth cracking.

## Why plan first?

Speed remains the goal; now I treat it as something earned by clearing friction from the loops that run most often.

* **Commit loops.** Pre-commit checks run in under a second, so an agent knows immediately when it violates style or types—no "push, wait, scroll logs" dance.
* **Release loops.** Semantic-release bumps versions and rewrites the changelog in a single pass; humans review value, not version strings.
* **Security loops.** Gitleaks, Bandit, CodeQL, and Trivy run as early as practical. These tools are seatbelts and airbags, not autopilot—human review and incident drills stay on the calendar.

The guiding question was always, *"Will this choice lower the long-term cost of secure, maintainable speed?"* A tool that saves fifteen seconds on every CI run but takes a day to debug once a year is worth it. One that saves a minute today but adds uncertainty six months out usually is not.

---

## Three guiding goals

1. **Bounded cycle-time.** An AI agent already waits about eight minutes for a Codex run; CI should not cost another eight.
2. **Shift-left robustness.** Tests, security, docs, and performance checks run from the first commit, so complexity grows linearly.
3. **Agent-friendly scaffolds.** Every repetitive task has a deterministic, one-command recipe, and every new capability advertises itself through a single declarative contract \[e.g., a Weather tool declares its input and output schema]. Agents discover what exists from high-level models instead of reverse engineering structure from file layouts and content at run time.

---

## The loops we tightened

* **Commit loops** fire quickly and locally, keeping feedback under a minute.
* **Release loops** package, tag, and document in one motion.
* **Security loops** surface issues early; guard-rails let agents run unattended while humans handle nuance.

Security still needs people. Guard-rails lock the obvious doors, but they don’t watch the hallway. We still review sensitive PRs, rotate keys, scan logs, patch base images, and rehearse incident drills. Automation just clears the routine checks so humans—and higher-level agents—can look for the subtle issues a static scan will miss.

If that feels like too much work on day one, consider the clock speed of agents. They push code around the clock, so a missing guard-rail can hurt days or weeks earlier than it would on a human-only team. A few hours of wiring now beats a long stretch of future damage control.

### Design-up-front is not Waterfall 2.0

Classic waterfall assumed long spec cycles and expensive change. **Waterfall + Agents feels different:** agents iterate continuously, but they need clear, deterministic rules to stay within bounds. We lay the rails first, then let the train run. It is still "move fast," just not "move fast and hope." Or, borrowing SpaceX's phrasing: *move fast and break staging, not production.*

---

## The design backlog in outline

1. **Environment cornerstone** – `bootstrap.sh` plus a lockfile; pre-commit hooks installed automatically.
2. **Quality gates** – Ruff linting, Ty static types, Typeguard runtime checks, BDD and property tests, coverage thresholds.
3. **Security & compliance** – pip-audit, Bandit, CodeQL, Gitleaks, Trivy, licence allow-list.
4. **Release & dependency flow** – Conventional Commits, semantic-release, Renovate, coverage comments, performance guard.
5. **Documentation & DX** – Sphinx + MyST, API and CLI references, diagram rendering, dev-container.
6. **Runtime & orchestration** – signed container image, SBOMs, Tilt live-reload, Hatch workspaces.
7. **AI-agent layer** – LangGraph backbone, tool registry, schema exports, contract fuzzing, cookie-cutter agents.
8. **Workflow polish** – Justfile command palette, smart labels, issue templates, minimal CI skeleton.

## Trade-off heuristics

Speed over familiarity; write ADRs for low lock-in; keep a single source of truth for each concept; start permissive, tighten later.

---

## Advice if you try this

Use a template as an idea checklist, not a blueprint. Ask whether each tool will shorten feedback loops six months from now. Record *why* in ADRs. Expect to swap tools; design exits rather than betting on permanence.

---

## What comes next

* **Implementation diaries.** Watching models turn stories into code.
* **High-level, low-code modelling.** Declarative descriptions of sprints and sagas so agents reason above file level.
* **Project-manager agents.** Coordinators who steer other agents without touching code.

Designing the rails was work, but also satisfying. Seeing messy parts click into place made the effort feel worthwhile—and necessary.
